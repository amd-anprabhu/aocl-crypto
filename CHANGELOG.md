All notable changes to AOCL Cryptography will be documented in this file.

## About AOCL Cryptography

AOCL Cryptography is a library consisting of basic cryptographic functions optimized for AMD Zen microarchitecture. This library provides multiple implementations of different cryptographic algorithms:

- AES cryptographic encryption / decryption routines
- SHA2, SHA3 Digest routines
- MAC (Cipher and Hash based) routines
- ECDH x25519 Key exchange functions
- RSA Encrypt/Decrypt and Sign/Verify functions
- Chacha20 stream cipher functions
- Poly1305 MAC functions
- Chacha20Poly1305 routines

## [5.3.0] - 2026

### Added

- **Digest**: SHA-256 multi-buffer support
- **MAC**: HMAC-SHA-256 multi-buffer support
- **Cipher**: Variable-length multi-buffer support for CBC and CFB
- **OpenSSL**: OpenSSL 3.5 is no longer experimental and is the default packaged OpenSSL version for 5.3
- **OpenSSL Provider**: AES-CBC enabled by default
- **RSA Provider**: Fallback support for verify/recover operations
- **Dispatch**: ISA-based per-algorithm kernel dispatch across the library

### Changed

- **Performance**:
  - ChaCha20: 8-block parallel AVX2 implementation for Zen 2 and Zen 3
  - AES-XTS: Tweak block computation redesigned from O(n) to O(log n)
  - AES-GCM: Reduced provider initialization overhead and optimized GHASH aggregated reduction / carry-less multiplication for Zen 4 and later
  - Poly1305: Optimized for Zen 4 and later with BMI2/ADX scalar x1 fast-path and r^16 combined loop improvements
- **Cipher**: CBC in-place buffer support is enabled by default; the same input/output buffer can be used without the `ALCP_ENABLE_CBC_INPLACE_BUFFER` flag
- **Cipher**: AESNI fallback added for cipher multi-buffer kernels

### Fixed

- **Cipher (AES-CFB)**: Heap buffer overflow for input length smaller than one cipher block
- **Cipher**: Segmentation fault on `nullptr` input/output in cipher operations
- **OpenSSL Provider (RSA)**: Corrected init ordering and PSS dispatch
- **OpenSSL Compat**: Buffer overrun in `memcpy` in cipher layer
- **RNG**: Replaced deprecated WinCrypt API (`CryptGenRandom`) with CNG `ProcessPrng`
- **RSA**: Corrected output size to use modulus size instead of input size
- **Build**: GCC 15 compatibility fixes

### Known Limitations

- AES Ciphers, RSA and EC algorithms are not supported in pre-AVX2 architectures
- RSA provider dispatch requires the runtime OpenSSL version to match the version used to compile the compat binary

### Changed

### Fixed

- **Build**: GCC 14 compatibility fixes
- **Build**: RHEL 8.6 (glibc <2.34) pthread affinity linkage fix
- **Error Handling**: Improved validation, unified macros, reliability & cleanup fixes

### Known Limitations
